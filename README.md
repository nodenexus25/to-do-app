# Kanban Board Refactoring

## üß© Module Structure Explanation

I structured the code into three separate modules to achieve better **separation of concerns** and **maintainability**:

### 1. **storage.js** - Data Management Layer
- **Responsibility**: All task data operations (CRUD operations)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Centralized data management with consistent API
  - localStorage persistence handled in one place
  - Priority-based sorting logic encapsulated here
  - **Fix for Bug 1**: Proper unique ID generation instead of `Date.now()` to prevent collisions

### 2. **render.js** - DOM Rendering Layer  
- **Responsibility**: All DOM manipulation and task visualization
- **Benefits**:
  - Isolated rendering logic makes UI changes easier
  - Efficient DOM updates with minimal re-renders
  - Priority-based task ordering handled automatically
  - HTML escaping prevents XSS vulnerabilities

### 3. **dragdrop.js** - Interaction Layer
- **Responsibility**: Drag-and-drop functionality and column management
- **Benefits**:
  - Clean separation of interaction logic
  - **Fix for Bug 3**: Proper error handling when tasks aren't found during drop operations
  - Validation ensures data integrity during moves
  - Easy to extend with additional interaction features

## ‚ö° Efficient DOM Updates Strategy

I implemented several strategies to ensure only changed elements are updated:

1. **Targeted Updates**: The `updateTask()` method only modifies specific task elements rather than re-rendering entire columns

2. **Status-Specific Rendering**: `renderColumn()` only updates one column at a time when needed

3. **Priority-Based Insertion**: New tasks are inserted at the correct position based on priority, avoiding full re-sorts

4. **Smart Replacement**: When tasks change status, only the affected task is moved, not the entire column

5. **Data-First Approach**: Changes are made to data first, then only the necessary DOM elements are updated

## üí° Next Feature: Task Due Dates with Visual Indicators

### Implementation Plan:

**Feature**: Add due dates to tasks with visual urgency indicators

**How I'd implement it**:

1. **Data Layer (storage.js)**:
   - Add `dueDate` field to task objects
   - Add method `getOverdueTasks()` to identify overdue items
   - Update sorting to consider due dates alongside priorities

2. **Rendering Layer (render.js)**:
   - Add due date display to task elements
   - Implement color-coding: red for overdue, orange for due today, green for future
   - Add calendar icon with date tooltip

3. **UI Enhancement**:
   - Add date picker to the task creation form
   - Create filter buttons to show/hide overdue tasks
   - Add visual urgency badges ("Due Today", "Overdue")

4. **Storage Enhancement**:
   - Add notification preferences to localStorage
   - Implement background checking for due dates
   - Add option to auto-move overdue tasks to "High Priority"

This feature would enhance task management by adding time-based urgency to the existing priority system, making the app more suitable for real-world project management needs.

## üêõ Bugs Fixed

1. **Bug 1 - ID Collisions**: Replaced `Date.now()` with sequential ID generation to prevent collisions when tasks are added quickly

2. **Bug 2 - Wrong Task Deletion**: Fixed task deletion by ensuring proper ID comparison and validation before removal

3. **Bug 3 - Drop Failures**: Added proper error handling and validation in drop operations to prevent failures when moving tasks to "In Progress"
